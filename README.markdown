# Face Dancer

This code is developed from a copy of [Faker](http://faker.rubyforge.org/) by 
[Benjamin Curtis](http://bencurtis.com), which itself is a port of the Perl library. I grabbed it so that I could
modify it to pull Lorem Ipsum text from the [Kwisatz Haderach](http://kwisatz.hadera.ch) which is also hosted on
Github as [haderach](http://github.com/mettadore/haderach).

# Status

I've just moved this code over, so it's currently still an implementation of Faker. I'll make notes here about
it's overall status.
